# Python-NI-DAQ
Simple python script to sample signals at desired frequency for NI-DAQ written using NI-DAQ SDK

I have modified some of the example scripts already given by NI-DAQ. 
I just understood the functions and modified the example script to sample sound signal from MAX4466 pre-amplifier microphone module at the desired frequency.
I recorded the sound in a CSV file, and then played the sound using the MATLAB sound function.
